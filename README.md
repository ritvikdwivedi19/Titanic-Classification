# Titanic-Classification

The Titanic classification problem is widely known for beginners, so I used my basic knowledge to answer the question "Will you survive?".

**Tech Stack**
### Python: Version 3.10

### Scikit-Learn: Version 1.1.2

### Pandas: Version 1.4.3

**Details**

Feature engineering was the best thing I learned in this project; I dropped the nan columns because they were misleading for the classification algorithm. Then I replaced the nan values with the coulmn's mean.

I splitted the dataset to 70% Train and 30% Test.

I tried eight different classification algorithms and the results was as following:

**LogisticRegression score is : 84.7
DecisionTreeClassifier Score is : 80.6%
KNeighborsClassifier Score is : 74.63%
GaussianNB Score is : 79.1%
SVC Score is : 67.54%
Perceptron Score is : 76.49%
SGDClassifier Score is : 81.34%
RandomForestClassifier Score is : 78.73%**
